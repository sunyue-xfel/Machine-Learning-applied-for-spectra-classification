LSTM, Transformer, Spectral clustering based models for spectral data classification

The models we presented range from supervised deep neural networks (state-of-the-art LSTM-based model and Transformer-based model) to unsupervised spectral clustering algorithm. These are the common architectures for time series processing. The PCA method is used as data preprocessing for dimensionality reduction. Three different ML algo-rithms are evaluated and compared for the classification task. The results show that all three methods can achieve 100% classification confidence. Among them, the spectra clustering method consumes the least calculation time (0.069 s), and the transformer-based method uses the most training time (0.204 s).
